## Objective:
BigSmokes Cigar is a leader in elite premium cigars that are sold around the globe. Headquartered in Florida, USA, they have been using an on-prem solution for their ecommerce website. This website is their primary source of orders and is backed by microservices. During cyclone Nirma, they discovered how vulnerable their data center is. The data center was wiped out due to the floods and BigSmokes went offline and hence no revenue generated for 2 weeks. This loss is perceived to be a tiny fraction of what BigSmokes will have to spend on Cloud Migration. They have chosen AWS as their cloud partner and are looking for a proposal from Cognizant to migrate their On-prem site to the cloud. The solution must be best-in-class, but at the same time convince the “very cost conservative” CFO who has to approve the finance. The decisive factors of a winning architecture will be

- __Highly Resilient__: Even if the American Continent is engulfed in floods, they expect to be in business. The have factories worldwide, so manufacturing isn’t a problem
- __Highly Available__: 99.9% available. No noticeable outage and hence no lost orders
- __Performance__: especially response to user requests should never go over a second
- __Cost should not be prohibitive__: While they can spend any amounts of money, the CFO is very particular that the solution MUST cost lesser than the On-Prem Solution
- __Value additions__: Innovation that would buy a better bang for the bucks shelled out by BigSmokes.
